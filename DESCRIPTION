Description: Plots traced ultrasound tongue imaging data according to a polar coordinate system. 
    There is currently support for plotting means and standard deviations of each category's trace;
    Smoothing Splines Analysis of Variance (SSANOVA) could be implemented as well.  The origin of the 
    polar coordinates may be defined manually or automatically determined based on different 
    algorithms.
    Currently 'ultrapolaRplot' supports ultrasound tongue imaging trace data from 'UltraTrace' 
    (<https://github.com/SwatPhonLab/UltraTrace>). 'UltraTrace' is capable of importing data from 
    Articulate Instruments AAA.
    'read_textgrid.R' is required for opening TextGrids to determine category and alignment
    information of ultrasound traces.
